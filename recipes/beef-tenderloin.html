<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It’s so easy to roast a juicy beef tenderloin that melts in your mouth with every bite. Even better when served with a rich and rustic, easy to make red wine sauce (or jus).</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the Tenderloin</h3>
<ul>
    <li>5-6 pounds (2.5-3 kg) beef tenderloin, trimmed</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons coarse salt</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, divided</li>
    <li>4 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Red Wine Sauce</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>
    <li>1 onion (or brown shallots) finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) dry red wine (Merlot or Pinot Noir)</li>
    <li>2 cups (500 ml) beef stock or broth</li>
    <li>1 sprig fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Beef Tenderloin</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Slice tenderloin in half crosswise to create 2 smaller roasts. If roast is untied, fold ends up against the centre/thicker part of each roast and tie with kitchen twine spaced about 1-inch apart. Make sure each halve is even in thickness.</li>
    <li>Chill in the refrigerator, uncovered, for 12 hours (if time allows).</li>
    <li>Let beef stand at room temperature for 1-2 hours before roasting.</li>
    <li>Arrange oven rack to the middle of your oven and preheat to 430°F (220°C).</li>
    <li>Season each beef tenderloin roast all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat until hot.</li>
    <li>Sear roasts on all four sides for about 3 minutes each side (about 12 minutes total), turning with tongs until well browned.</li>
    <li>Combine butter, garlic and Dijon (if using) together in a small bowl while roasts are searing. Set one half of the butter mixture aside to use later for the sauce.</li>
    <li>Slather remaining garlic butter over each roast (about 2 tablespoons each).</li>
    <li>Transfer skillet into the hot oven. (Alternatively: Transfer roast to a lightly greased roasting pan or baking dish.)
    </li>
    <li>Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120-125°F for medium rare (about 20-25 minutes). 
        *Or cook to your liking: 
        115-120°F for rare
        130-135°F for medium
        (Temperature will continue to rise about 5 degrees while the meat rests.)</li>
        <li>Transfer the roast to a carving board and let rest for 15 minutes. Keep the juices in the pan to make the sauce (see below).</li>
        <li>Carve the beef tenderloin into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve the beef tenderloin with the optional red wine sauce.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Red Wine Sauce</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Skim fat off the remaining juices in the pan (if any).</li>
    <li>Heat oil in the same pan with remaining pan juices over medium-high heat. Sauté onion for about 3 minutes until lightly browned and softened, scraping up any browned bits left from the beef.</li>
    <li>Add thyme/rosemary and season with pepper. Continue cooking for a further minute or so while stirring often.</li>
    <li>Pour in red wine and cook until reduced by half.</li>
    <li>Add in beef stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until reduced by half. Remove the sprig of thyme or rosemary.</li>
    <li>Season with salt to taste and whisk in reserved garlic butter. Pour in any juices left over from the resting steaks just before serving.</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL FOR A SMOOTH AND SILKY SAUCE: strain sauce through a sieve and discard the onion before serving.</li>
